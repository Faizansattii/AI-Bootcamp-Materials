    "### 3. Embeddings 🔢\n",
    "- Convert text to numerical vectors\n",
    "- Similar meanings = similar vectors\n",
    "- Enable semantic search (not just keyword matching)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Vector Stores 💾\n",
    "- FAISS for fast similarity search\n",
    "- Index documents for quick retrieval\n",
    "- Return most relevant chunks\n",
