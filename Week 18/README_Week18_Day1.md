## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Students Need:
- ✅ Docker Desktop installed (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- ✅ Terminal/command line access
- ✅ Text editor (VS Code recommended)
- ✅ Week 17 FastAPI knowledge (optional but helpful)
- ✅ Basic Linux commands knowledge

### Instructor Needs:

## 💡 Key Teaching Principles

### 1. **Start with Why**
- Always explain the problem before the solution
- Use real-world scenarios students can relate to
- "Works on my machine" resonates with everyone

### 2. **Use Analogies**
- Shipping containers for Docker concept
- Classes/objects for images/containers
- Recipes for images, cakes for containers

### 3. **Show, Don't Just Tell**
- Live demos are crucial
- Terminal commands should be demonstrated
- Show errors and how to fix them

### 4. **Build Incrementally**
- Start with hello-world (simplest)
- Progress to interactive containers
- End with custom Dockerfiles
- Each step builds on previous

### 5. **Address Confusion Proactively**
- Images vs containers is always confusing
- Explain stopped containers still exist
- Clarify immutable images concept
